This program creates a class of YourFirstNameLine objects
The class has 6 private instance fields:
    a start Point
    an end Point
    x-coordinate 1
    x-coordinate 2
    y-coordinate 1
    y-coordinate 2
It also has 6 instance methods:
    a constructor, which accepts 2 Point objects as parameters
    a start Point getter
    an end Point getter
    toString method, which prints out the line's start and end coordinates
    getSlope method, which returns the slope of the line as a double
    draw method, which uses the DrawingPanel class to draw the line
